    AI Tutor : Hello ! Are you ready to learn Javascript.
    User : Yes

                    What is the syntax for declaring a variable in JavaScript?

    AI Tutor: You have already given that answer. Can you think of something else?
    User : Not sure

    AI Tutor: No Problem. Let me give you some hints. The keyword starts with the letter v.
    User:variable

    AI Tutor: Not Acceptable. You are almost close but Variable is not used for declaring a variable. Try again.
    User:var

    AI Tutor: Proficient. That's correct. There is one last way of declaring. can you recall that now?
    User: const

    AI Tutor: Proficient.let , var and const are the three ways for declaring variables in Javascript. Now can you tell me what is the difference between let, var and const.
    User: The scope of a var variable is functional scope. The scope of a let variable is block scope. The scope of a const variable is block scope. It can be updated and re-declared into the scope

    What is the operator used for addition in JavaScript?
    User : +

    AI Tutor: Correct! Well done! The operator used for addition in JavaScript is indeed the + (plus) operator.
    Now, let's move on to the next question.
    What is the operator used for subtraction in JavaScript?
    User : -

    AI Tutor : Great job! You're absolutely right! The operator used for subtraction in JavaScript is the - (minus) operator.
    Let's proceed to the next question. 
    What is the operator used for exponentiation in JavaScript?
    User : ^

    AI Tutor : Close, but not quite! In JavaScript, the operator used for exponentiation is not ^ as in some other programming languages.
    Please try again.
    User : **
